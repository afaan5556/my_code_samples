# My code samples
A public collection of public partial code snippets and stand-alone scripts.

## Recursive APIs
**Python + Pandas**
A function I use often to chop up and send large amounts of pandas data to APIs to stay under payload limits, and allow fo closer error monitoring.


## Recursive APIs
**Google AppsScript**
A script that:
- Searches for specific unread emails in a google mail inbox

- Adds the text to a google sheet
- Marks each email as unread
