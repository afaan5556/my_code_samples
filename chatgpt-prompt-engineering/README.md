## Introduction

Two types:
- Base LLM
	- Predicts next word, based on training data
	- "Once upon a time, there was a unicorn" >> "that lived in a magical forest with her friends"
	- "What is the capital of France" >> "What is France's largest city", "What is the currency in France"
- Instruction Tuned LLM
	- Tries to follow instructions
	- "What is the capital of France" >> "Paris"
	- Uses Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
	Helpful, Honest, Harmless
